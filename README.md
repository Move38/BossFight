## Objective
Multiplayer _coopetition_ game where all players work together to defeat 1 Boss, but only the player to land the killing blow wins!

## Setup
To play Boss Fight(WIP) you need 3 types of pieces.
1. **Avatar** - this is you for all intents and purposes and you will gain health, build up your attack, and hopefully defeat the man. (yup, I just decided this game is about overthrowing _the man_)
2. **Rune** - think of this as a magical token. It is available each turn to give health or stockpile weapons. (do you want attack or HP?)
3. **Boss** - this wouldn't be very exciting without _the man_ to defeat. The boss shows its health at all times and takes damage from players hits. The boss can potentially heal itself every round, so you'll have to be swift in the killing.

## Gameplay

### Actions
Players can perform 1 action on their turn. 

- **Engage** Move your Blink near the Boss. This allows you to attack, but also lets the boss attack you. 
- **Attack** the Boss for how much attack you've stockpiled. Default 1. You can only attack if you are Engaged in combat with the boss. 
- **Stockpile** to gain 1 more attack power. Attacking resets your stockpile back to 1. 
- **Heal** yourself for 1 health. 
- **Disengage** Move your Blink away from the Boss. 

Once a turn has ended, tap the boss to initiate its action. 

You can have up to 6 enhancements your own piece. It can be 3 Health/3 Attack, 5 Health/1 Attack, or any combination you wish. 

### Boss Actions

The boss can perform one of the following...

- **Attack** all players engaged to in combat with the Boss for 1 damage. 
- **Buff** itself to gain more attack power.  
- **Heal** itself for 1 health. 

### Round

The Boss will either give itself 1 health or deal damage to every player based on how much they've stockpiled. If it's been buffed by a player, the Boss's attack will deal 1 more damage in addition to whatever damage it would deal normally. It will then lose its buff. 

### 

### Death

When a player loses all their health, they are forcefully disengaged from the boss. Their health and attack values also go to 1.
