## Objective
Multiplayer _coopetition_ game where all players work together to defeat 1 Boss, but only the player to land the killing blow wins!

## Setup
To play Boss Fight(WIP) you need 3 types of pieces.
1. **Avatar** - this is you for all intents and purposes and you will gain health, build up your attack, and hopefully defeat the man. (yup, I just decided this game is about overthrowing _the man_)
2. **Rune** - think of this as a magical token. It is available each turn to give health or stockpile weapons. (do you want XP or HP?)
3. **Boss** - this wouldn't be very exciting without _the man_ to defeat. The boss shows its health at all times and takes damage from players hits. The boss can potentially heal itself every round, so you'll have to be swift in the killing.

## Gameplay

### Actions
Players can perform 1 action on their turn. 

- **Attack** the Boss for how much attack you've stockpiled. Default 1. 
- **Stockpile** and gain 1 more attack for your next turn. Attacking resets your stockpile back to 1. 
  - you can stockpile another player **-OR-**
  - you can buff the Boss and have it deal extra damage if it chooses to attack on its turn 
- **Heal**
  - yourself **-OR-**
  - another player **-OR-**
  - the Boss (even _the man_ gets some chicken noodle soup sometimes)

### Rounds

Once every player has had their turn, all players will attach themselves to the Boss and click the Boss. 

The Boss will either give itself 1 health or deal damage to every player based on how much they've stockpiled. If it's been buffed by a player, the Boss's attack will deal 1 more damage in addition to whatever damage it would deal normally. 

## Death

When a player loses all their health, they are out for the next round. Their health and stockpile reset to 1. 

### Negotiations

Sometimes you just can't take down the man all by yourself. That's when negotations come in. On your turn, you can try to convince another player to take a specific action when it gets around to their turn, like healing or stockpiling you/the Boss. This negotation is in addition to the normal action you'd take on your turn. 

If the other player complies, you owe them a favor later on. The other player can call in their favor whenever it's your turn, and since you're a player of honor, you must comply to their request, even (especially) if you really don't want to. If you're not careful, you may end up helping another player get the final strike on the Boss, letting them hog all the glory of the kill.
